### What is HAProxy?

HAProxy is a high-performance, open source load balancer and reverse proxy for TCP and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) applications. Users can use HAProxy to distribute workloads and improve website and application performance. Performance improvements include minimized response times and increased throughput. Users use HAProxy in high-traffic services, such as GitHub and Twitter.

Load balancers can distribute workloads across computers, networks, disk drives or central processing units. HAProxy, included in many distributions of Linux, is one of the leading standards in software load balancing.

### NGINX is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.
